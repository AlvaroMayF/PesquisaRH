‚öôÔ∏è How to Run the Project Locally
Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your machine.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed

Git installed

A running MySQL database server

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME]/[REPOSITORY-NAME].git
cd [REPOSITORY-NAME]

2. Set Up the Virtual Environment
It is good practice to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Dependencies
With the virtual environment activated, install all necessary libraries.

pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: Make sure you have a requirements.txt file with all dependencies, such as Flask, mysql-connector-python, etc.)

4. Configure the Database
Create a database on your MySQL server (e.g., pesquisa_rh).

Import the table structure (you can use an SQL dump script from your development database).

Set up the environment variables. Create a .env file in the project root with your credentials:

DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=pesquisa_rh

5. Run the Application
Execute the command below to start the Flask development server.

flask run

The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or the address shown in your terminal).
